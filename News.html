<div id="Course" class="Home fontColour">Update on UK tutition fees</div>
<div class="container students ">

<p class="para fontColour centre student student2">Next year, UK students will have to pay extra for their university education in England because undergraduate tuition will increase to £9,535 annually.

  The fees, which have been set at a maximum of £9,250 since 2017, have increased by £285.
  
  
  In Parliament on Monday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson informed lawmakers that maintenance loans would also increase to assist students in keeping up with living expenses.
  
  Higher maintenance loans "will make a real difference to the poorest students," according to the National Union of Students, who referred to the tuition fee increase as a "sticking plaster."
  
  The increased fees provide colleges with a financial boost to help them deal with their most pressing financial issues.

  Vice-chancellors, however, will be curious about the government's future plans as the move only impacts fees and loans for the 2025–2026 academic year.

According to Phillipson, in the upcoming months, the government will declare another "major reform" for sustained university spending.


According to her, the government must "make the difficult choices required to place universities on a more stable financial foundation."

However, she informed the BBC that in order to "drive better value for students and for the taxpayer," they would also be "demanding more of universities" and examining factors like the compensation of top executives.
